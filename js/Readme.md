The javascript runtime!

It would be nice to:
- have evaluation logs on a per-value basis.
  - oooh yeah that would be so dope.
  - ok, so we're tracing execution, basically, right?
  - showing the decompiled values n stuff
  - and then showing what the values were when it was executed.
  - not totally sure how to keep track of it, but it's super cool.
  - would also be nice to have a format where the rust runtime could also do the jig.
