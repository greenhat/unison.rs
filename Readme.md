# unison.rs

An experimental parser + runtime for unison.

Note that this doesn't do any type-checking, and also does not write unison files.
The assumption is that if a term has been written to disk, that's because unison type-checked it, and it is correct.

The main goal of this project is to allow unison programs to run in the browser, through wasm. ðŸ¤ž


## What about javascript compilation?

I think we could do a javascript transpilation setup that supported effects, but it would be a little gnarly â€” something similar to babelâ€™s async/await transpilation setup â€” and if we want to be able to do with without sacrificing a ton of performance, weâ€™d probably want to compile two different versions of any function thatâ€™s effect-polymorphic; one for the pure case (that doesnâ€™t need the extra bookkeeping for effects) and one for the effect-ful case, that keeps track of stack variables, etc.
